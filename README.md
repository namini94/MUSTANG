## Overview
**MU**lti-sample **S**patial **T**ranscriptomics data **AN**alysis with cross-sample transcriptional similarity **G**uidance (**MUSTANG**) is a computaional framework, which is capable of performing multi-sample spatial transcriptomics spot cellualar deconvolution by allowing both cross-sample expression based similarity information sharing as well as spatial correlation in gene expression patterns within samples.
