# Summary

This tutorial demonstrates the workflow for generating the semi-synthetic multi-sample ST data from the STARmap, Smart-seq mouse visual cortex data.

## Dataset

The STARmap mouse visual cortex is publicly available but for sake of convenience, all the required data for semi-synthetic ST data generation can be downloaded from the link below:

## Semi-synthetic Data generation

Here, we describe how one can generate the simulated low resolution semi-synthetic ST data from the STARmap mouse visual cortex data. As an example here we generate one sample with the window size of 600 pixels:

```python
